# WebGridExample
Initial MVC WebGrid

This is the base setup for an enhanced WebGrid for ASP.NET MVC.

The series will start with this post: http://www.danylkoweb.com/Blog/aspnet-mvc-enhancing-the-webgrid-series-99. I'll add more posts as the series continues.

If you have any features you want included in this WebGrid, post a comment on the site and we'll see if we can add the feature into it.
